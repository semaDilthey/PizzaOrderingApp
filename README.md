# PizzaOrderingApp
Simple one screen test task for ordering pizza. Fetching information from 3 different APIs and distributing it across controllers.
VIPER architecture was used in its creation. CoreData is used to show menus when there is no internet. 
The main task of this testapp is to match the design and scrolling of the menu vertically/horizontally. I consider it successfully completed

## Prototype:  [FIGMA](https://www.figma.com/file/QAV7uRlO2cI3lYjNOVIwmo/Тестовое-IOS-(Copy)?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design)

## What needs to be done:

- Implement the main screen for a food delivery application.
- You can hardcode any photos into the banners.
- The main task is to create an identical layout with categories and a menu block.
- The category bar should stick to the top bar when scrolling.
- When a category is clicked, the list should scroll to the corresponding section.
- Use any open API that fits the current needs.
Optional:
- Offline mode: i.e., if there is no network access, display the last loaded data.
